This is a small project showing you how you can interact with the Ethereum Blockchain with Python along with Web3py using the Infura API. The Infura API suite provides instant access over HTTPS and WebSockets to the Ethereum and IPFS networks. 

It is important to remember that there is no central administrative system where the data can be downloaded from. Interconnected nodes or "peers" share resources with each other and store verified copies of data or parts of it. Afterwhich the network executes the Ethereum protocal. The Etherem protocal defines the rules of interaction between nodes and smart contracts over the network. 

web3.js is a collection of libraries which allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node, using an HTTP, WebSocket or IPC connection.
