This is a small project showing you how you can interact with the Ethereum Blockchain with Python along with Web3py using the Infura API. The Infura API suite provides instant access over HTTPS and WebSockets to the Ethereum and IPFS networks. 

It is important to remember that there is no central administrative system where the data can be downloaded from. Interconnected nodes or "peers" share resources with each other and store verified copies of data or parts of it. Afterwhich the network executes the Ethereum protocal. The Etherem protocal defines the rules of interaction between nodes and smart contracts over the network. 

Web3.py is a python library for interacting with Ethereum. Its API is derived from the Web3.js Javascript API and should be familiar to anyone who has used web3.js.
